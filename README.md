# 3D Human Action Recognition from Skeletal Data with Deep Convolutional Neural Network via Enhanced-SPMFs.

## Introduction

This repository includes the codes and pre-trained models for the paper: "**_Spatio-Temporal Image Representation of 3D Skeletal Movements for View-Invariant Action Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks_"** by Huy Hieu Pham, Houssam Salmane, Louahdi Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin, which was submitted to [The IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) ](https://www.computer.org/web/tpami), [Special Issue on RGB-D Vision: Methods and Applications](http://yulanguo.me/pami.html).


**Requirements**

To train the deep neural networks in our experiments, you need to download and install [Keras](http://www.vlfeat.org/) with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend and put image data to the folders. 

**Experimental results**

(will be updated as soon as possible upon publication.)
