# 3D Human Action Recognition from Skeletal Data with Deep Convolutional Neural Network via Enhanced-SPMFs.

## Introduction

This repository includes codes and models for our paper: "**_Spatio-Temporal Image Representation of 3D Skeletal Movements for View-Invariant Action Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks_"** Huy Hieu Pham, Houssam Salmane, Louahdi Khoudour, Alain Crouzil, Pablo Zegers, and Sergio A. Velastin, which was submitted to the [Journal of Sensors - MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors).


## Requirements

To train the deep neural networks in our experiments, you need to download and install [Keras 2.x.x](https://keras.io/) with [TensorFlow > 1.6](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend and put image data to the folders: data/MSR Action3D; data/NTU-RGB+D, data/SBU Interaction and data/KARD. 

## Experimental results

(will be updated as soon as possible upon publication.)
